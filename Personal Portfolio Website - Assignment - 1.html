      <h3>Implementation of Stroop Test</h3>
      Development of a Stroop test using python tkinter. To know how strong a
      person’s mind and the fast reflexes and reaction times we created this. It
      is purely depended on individual ability and the wide range of perception.

      <h3>Machine Learning Algorithm for Brain Stroke Detection</h3>
      Developed a machine learning algorithm to predict brain stroke likelihood
      using various classifiers. Utilized Python, Django, and machine learning
      libraries (e.g., NumPy, scikit-learn) for data analysis and model
      building.Designed user-friendly web application modules for data upload,
      preprocessing, model training, and result prediction. Languages: Python
