  <h1>My Projects</h1>
  <h3>Implementation of Stroop Test</h3>
  Development of a Stroop test using python tkinter. To know how strong a
  person’s mind and the fast reflexes and reaction times we created this. It is
  purely depended on individual ability and the wide range of perception.<br /><br />
  <b>Languages</b>: Python Technologies: Tkinter, OpenCV Modules/Libraries:
  random, NumPy Tools: PyCharm, Jupyter Notebook, Git Environment: Anaconda
  <h3>E-Library Management System</h3>
  Developed an Online Library Management System to automate library tasks,
  enhancing efficiency for librarians and users. Enabled students to search for
  books, view book statuses, and request books, while providing administrators
  with features for book management and reporting. <br /><br /><b>Languages</b>:
  HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript Technologies: Visual Studio Code Tools: XAMPP
  (Apache, MySQL, PHP), GitHub Environment: Windows Operating System
  <h3>Exercise Tutoring Website</h3>
  Promotes the importance of regular physical activity for overall
  health.Highlights the limitations of existing mobile-centric tutoring
  applications. Introduces a new web based fitness application to address these
  limitations.<br /><br />
  <b>Languages</b>: JavaScript (ReactJS), HTML, CSS Technologies: Node.js,
  ReactJS Modules/Libraries: React Router DOM, React Horizontal Scrolling Menu,
  React Loader Spinner, HTML React Parser, Moment.js Tools: Visual Studio Code,
  Git, GitHub Environment: Windows/Mac/Linux, Platform – IA-32, X86-64
  <h3>Machine Learning Algorithm for Brain Stroke Detection</h3>
  Developed a machine learning algorithm to predict brain stroke likelihood
  using various classifiers. Utilized Python, Django, and machine learning
  libraries (e.g., NumPy, scikit-learn) for data analysis and model
  building.Designed user-friendly web application modules for data upload,
  preprocessing, model training, and result prediction. <br /><br />
